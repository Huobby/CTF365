# Day 3

## Challenge 
Basic overflow

## Category
Exploit

## Description
This challenge is for the ones that want to learn basic exploitation.

```bash
ssh narnia0@narnia.labs.overthewire.org
```
The password is the same as username.

You should run the program `/narnia/narnia0` and try to get the shell of user `narnia1`. The flag is in `/etc/narnia_pass/narnia1`.

In order make it easier for you to spot the vuln and abuse it, we give you the [source code](./narnia0.c).
